# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Deepak , and I'm passionate about web development. I recently created a dynamic Student Progress Card application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to input student data, and it dynamically presents the information in an attractive and informative way on a web page.

ðŸš€ Here are some key features of the project:

- Input data directly from the user.
- Dynamically generate a progress card with the entered data.
- Utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a seamless user experience.

I enjoyed working on this project, and it showcases my skills in front-end development. Feel free to explore the repository to see the code and try it out yourself!

Happy coding! ðŸ˜„
